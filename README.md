This project focuses on developing a Bank Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard to visually represent and analyze the factors contributing to customer churn within a bank. The dashboard aims to provide insights into why customers are leaving, enabling the bank to implement strategies for retention.

Key aspects of the analysis presented in the dashboard include:
Churn by Country: Showing the proportion of churned customers from different countries (France, Germany, Spain).
Churn by Gender: Displaying the distribution of churn between male and female customers.
Churn by Age and Gender: Analyzing churn rates across different age groups, segmented by gender.
Churn by Credit Score: Examining the relationship between credit score ranges and customer churn.
Churn by Complain and Gender: Investigating the impact of customer complaints on churn, broken down by gender.
Churn by Card Type: Analyzing the churn rate for different card types (Diamond, Gold, Platinum, Silver).
The dashboard uses a combination of pie charts, bar charts, and potentially other visual elements to effectively communicate the churn patterns and trends. The overall goal is to provide a clear and actionable overview of customer churn, enabling the bank to identify at-risk customer segments and develop targeted retention strategies.
